Tuning a high-DPI Linux system requires two steps:
1. Setting the MATLAB scale factor
2. Calibrating the system's DPI
The MATLAB scale factor affects MATLAB desktop and the size/position of windows.
The system DPI determines the scale and font size of axes and labels.
The two tuning steps are described below:
1. To set the MATLAB scale factor, please execute the following commands in the MATLAB Command Window:
```
>> s = settings;s.matlab.desktop.DisplayScaleFactor
>> s.matlab.desktop.DisplayScaleFactor.PersonalValue = 1.5
```
Here the scale factor has been set to 1.5.
2. To calibrate the system's DPI to match the scale factor, please use the following terminal commands:
```
% xdpyinfo | grep resolution
  resolution:    96x96 dots per inch
% xrandr --dpi 144
```
The DPI value chosen should be the resolution found with "xdpyinfo" multiplied by the MATLAB scale factor that was set. In the example, 96 Ã— 1.5 = 144.
MATLAB must be restarted after Step 2.
